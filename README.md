Unfinished project just for fun. 
The idea was to capture my own annotated traffic directly from a proxy, and enrich that data using either the OpenAI API or a self-hosted option. (the main idea was to store and facilitate all research I've done for every bug bounty program into a queryable knowledge graph)
